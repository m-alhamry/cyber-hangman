        <h4>
            The Hangman game is a word-guessing challenge.
            <br>One of the players (or computer) selects a secret word and determines the number of letters in it using
            signs (such as: _ _ _ _ _).
            <br>The other player tries to guess the letters one by one.
            <br>If the letter is correct, it is written in its right place (if the letter is repeated in the word, it
            writes all its repetitions in its appropriate place), and if it is wrong, it is added part of the gallows
            drawing.
            <br>The goal is to guess the word before the gallows are completed, which is usually done in 8 wrong steps.
